# Financial-Data-Analysis-using-EDFS-and-Spark

I formulated an emulated distributed file system using MongoDB, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of big datasets for which I implemented functionalities including directory creation, file retrieval enabling users to access and manipulate stored data all of this using MongoDB client and commands.
Then we integrated data partitioning techniques within the EDFS, allowing efficient distribution and retrieval of data across database.
